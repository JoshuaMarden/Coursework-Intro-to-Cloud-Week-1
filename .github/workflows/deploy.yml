To address the potential issue with secrets not being correctly recognized in the workflow, you can explicitly set the secrets as environment variables within the job. Here's how to structure your workflow with the secrets explicitly defined within the job:

Workflow Configuration with Secrets as Environment Variables
yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy to Staging server

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      REMOTE_HOST: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
      REMOTE_USER: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
      REMOTE_TARGET: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_TARGET }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to Server
        uses: easingthemes/ssh-deploy@main
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ env.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          remote-host: ${{ env.REMOTE_HOST }}
          remote-user: ${{ env.REMOTE_USER }}
          ARGS: '-rlgoDzvc -i --delete'
          SOURCE: 'dist/'
          target: ${{ env.REMOTE_TARGET }}
          EXCLUDE: '/dist/, /node_modules/'
